## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
[W3SCHOOLS - https://www.w3schools.com/]
[MDN Web Docs - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/web/javascript/reference/global_objects/math/random]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[Since I do not have any prior knowledge regarding HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I am so confused at the beginning of the pre-work assignment. 
It took me several minutes to understand functions and syntax that are new to my brain. Nonetheless, I managed to overcome such difficulty 
through the help of the links that CodePath gave in the assignment. As I go through every step, I made sure to read the definition of each 
unfamiliar keyword that I encounter in order to fully understand their nature and concept. I also encountered challenges in terms of designing 
my game. As I was very new to CSS and HTML, I had to do a trial-and-error in terms of editing button shapes, margins, and the like just to make
my webpage pleasant and neat.]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[Questions that mainly concern designing, logic, and security came up into my mind after completing my submission. For instance, 
How do gaming sites create a very complex UI?
How do gaming sites incorporate their complex logic to their website design?
How do gaming sites allow a character to walk?
How do shopping and banking sites implement data security?
Can other people edit my webpage?
How do people incorporate real money into a webpage?
How can google chrome handle several websites at once?
]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[If I had a few more hours to work on this project, I would spend them in implementing game levels, incorporating sounds that builds into a famous tune when the highest level is reached, incorporating a background 
sound when the game is not being played, improving my gameâ€™s design to make it more attractive to the user, and so on.]
